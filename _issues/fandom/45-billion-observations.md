<p>Things that make me laugh: when Sarah McLachlan says “there's no one left to finger”</p>
<p>How Janie said it was so obvious that song was about her grandmother.</p>
<p>Did she really know? Was it really obvious? Or did she read it on the Internet / did the Internet even exist.</p>
<p>That feminism has been getting kind of retro lately, maybe it's not the first time.</p>
<p>I take a selfie in the bathroom mirror with a pink headband holding my bangs back. </p>
<p>I'm growing out my bangs  / it's retro.</p>
<p>It's a nod to myself in high school.</p>
<p>A shout out to myself &#38; that things are changing.</p>
<p>A powder blue t-shirt with velvet dragon decal on it.</p>
<p>A thing I wore to Lillith Faire</p>
<p>I thought, I really need a room of my own</p> 
<p>If that's what it takes these days</p> 
<p>To find yourself, your voice.</p> 
<p>To actually be in the woods.</p>  
<p>If we got married</p> 
<p>In the woods, like hippies but not.</p> 
<p>Like feminists / in the sad gay 90s.</p> 
<p>Things that Make Me Cry:</p> 
<p>I thought I wanted to be the other girls but maybe I don't.</p> 
<p>I imagine my karaoke rendition of Galileo, it floors you.</p> 
<p>I imagine my rendition of Possession by Sarah McLachlan and I'm shaking my ass &#38; it's so smart &#38; I’ll never sleep.</p> 
<p>That scene in the show where they're triumphantly singing along to the Indigo Girls in the car on the way to the women's music festival.</p>  
<p>&#38; you might feel a shaft of light make its way across your face.</p>  
<p>I want my room to be so full of light.</p> 
<p>So 90s it makes the song skip.</p>

<p>My nose is bleeding should I go see my Sex and the City doctor.</p>  
<p>She'd be like, did you move here for a man or a job.</p> 
<p>I'm walking in Midtown, I’m like, good for you in your colorful outfit. Sad for a sea of black.</p> 
<p>I went to California with a youthful aching in my heart and I left it there / didn't.</p>  
<p>My sister and my text relationship is so I do this, I do that.</p>  
<p>I text her, I washed my new bra and it's so tight I keep gasping for air in my cubicle.</p> 
<p>She writes back I fell asleep on the train and when I woke up a spider was dangling in front of my eyes.</p> 
<p>My cartoon world where I live with you. Where I float across the ocean.</p> 
<p>Where I miss my stop every day but it doesn't matter / girl power.</p>  
<p>Sometimes I post the things in my head onto the Internet for a certain few.</p> 
<p>For those to whom I'm like "good for you," your pastel dress in a sea of black</p>  
<p>Maybe I'm like, hungry. Gluten free Oreos. Can't hear myself think.</p> 
<p>I'm listening to Free Fallin’ on my Walkman.</p> 
<p>I go into the grocery store and they're playing it too.</p>  
<p>Cause I forgot the line &#38; Tom Petty reminded me.</p>  
<p>I wanna fly down over Mulholland / wanna collapse on the grocery store floor.</p> 
<p>The universe told me to go into the grocery store and buy just cookies and milk.</p>  
<p>D would've called it a "heroic purchase.”</p> 
<p>My therapist was like, maybe you're not over it.</p>  
<p>The taste of the milk bored my tongue.</p>  
<p>I'm walking around the grocery store.</p>  
<p>Epic by Faith No More.</p> 
<p>I'm running on the treadmill listening to Lady Gaga and thinking about my sister.</p> 
<p>And my sister calls and leaves a message that she was listening to Lady Gaga on the treadmill and thinking of me.</p>  
<p>I send her two girls and two crystal ball emojis.</p>  
<p>What if C dies. And I'm like, how could you not need poetry?</p>
<p>Walking home w/ my grocery bag on my arm, it feels like a tourniquet.</p>
<p>Use my computer as an extension cord. Exercise or sleep.</p>  
<p>You emptied the laundry all over the bed and I screamed like a bomb exploded.</p>  
<p>All the things that I'm interested in.</p> 
<p>Will I take a selfie at the end of the world.</p> </div></div></div>
