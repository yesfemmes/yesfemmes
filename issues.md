  <h1><span>Current</span><br><a class="issues-current-browse" href="#">Fandom Issue</a></h1>
  <p>This issue explores fandom as an orientation, wondering what happens when we approach the world with gushiness, with desire to connect or become. The Fandom Issue is interested in mapping the worlds that emerge when we embrace and express our fannishness and in how identities and communities form in response to what we're gripped by. It looks into the ways pop culture icons, dead poets, and out-of-print books have opened portals to worlds, created models for the possible, or simply kept us alive.</p>

   <h1><span>Past</span><br><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/issue-first">First Issue</a></h1>
  <p>Our first foray into working toward a femme aesthetic. Open to potentially-contradicting ideas of what's femme, the work in this issue takes seashells seriously as a radical symbol of a possible future, calls out for goddesses, offers an interactive fairytale of trauma, narrates transition via audio postcards, and more. </p>
